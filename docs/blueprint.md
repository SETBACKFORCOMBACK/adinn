# **App Name**: ModelCostAI

## Core Features:

- Model Upload: Enable users to upload 3D model files in common formats like .obj and .stl.
- Interactive 3D Viewer: Provide an interactive 3D viewer using Three.js to display uploaded models.
- AI-Driven Parameter Prediction: Integrate Gemini AI to predict inputs such as material type, welding time, and other relevant parameters from the 3D model data based on text format. The AI acts as a tool to support an overall calculation of an appropriate cost.
- Automated Cost Estimation: Utilize the AI-predicted inputs, model dimensions, and user selections to calculate an estimated cost for the 3D model project.
- Material Selection: Allow users to select materials and view their choices in the 3D render. Offer suggestions for alternate choices.
- Project History: Display past projects.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application is fully responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and reliability in cost estimation.
- Background color: Light blue (#E8F0FE) with low saturation.
- Accent color: Analogous vibrant purple (#8934eb) for interactive elements and highlights, offering a modern look and good contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a tech-forward feel. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure readability and a modern aesthetic.
- Code Font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying any code snippets in the app.
- Use clear, geometric icons to represent different model parameters and actions, ensuring intuitive navigation.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout for presenting model data and estimation results effectively.
